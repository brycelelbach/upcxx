### UPC\+\+ is a PGAS extension for C\+\+. ###

UPC++ is a parallel programming extension for using PGAS (partitioned global address space) for C++. UPC++ has three main objectives: 1) to provide an object-oriented PGAS programming model in the context of the popular C++ language; 2) to add useful parallel programming idioms unavailable in UPC, such as asynchronous remote function invocation and multidimensional arrays, to support complex scientific applications; 3) to offer an easy on-ramp to PGAS programming through interoperability with other existing parallel programming systems (e.g., MPI, OpxenMP, CUDA).  Please see the [UPC++ wiki](https://bitbucket.org/upcxx/upcxx/wiki) for more info.
