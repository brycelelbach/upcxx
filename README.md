# *Legacy* UPC++ Version 0.1

In November 2016, we froze this UPC++ repository as part of a transition from UPC++ 0.1 to UPC++ 1.0.  
Please visit the [new Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/upcxx/wiki/Home) for information about, and downloads of, UPC++ 1.0.

### UPC\+\+: a PGAS extension for C\+\+ ###

UPC++ is a parallel programming extension for developing C++ applications with the partitioned global address space (PGAS) model.  UPC++ has three main objectives: 

* Provide an object-oriented PGAS programming model in the context of the popular C++ language
* Add useful parallel programming idioms unavailable in Unified Parallel C (UPC), such as asynchronous remote function invocation and multidimensional arrays, to support complex scientific applications
* Offer an easy on-ramp to PGAS programming through interoperability with other existing parallel programming systems (e.g., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA)
